## üß™ Testing Procedures

### 1. Header & Navigation Test
**Desktop ‚Üí Mobile Transition**
1. Start at desktop width (1200px+)
2. Slowly resize to 768px - observe navigation collapse
3. At 768px: hamburger menu should appear
4. Click hamburger: menu should slide down with backdrop blur
5. Test all navigation links work
6. Check logo remains visible and properly sized

**Mobile Specific (‚â§480px)**
- [ ] Menu button is easily tappable (44px min)
- [ ] Menu slides smoothly without jank
- [ ] All navigation links have adequate spacing
- [ ] Text remains readable at all sizes

### 2. Hero Section Test
**Responsive Background**
1. Check animated gradient displays properly
2. Verify geometric overlays scale appropriately
3. Test performance on lower-end devices

**Typography Scale**
- Desktop (1200px+): Title should be ~4.8rem
- Tablet (768px): Title should be ~3.8rem  
- Mobile (480px): Title should be ~3.2rem
- Small Mobile (360px): Title should be ~2.8rem

### 3. Work Experience Timeline Test
**Layout Verification**
1. Desktop: Timeline should have left-aligned bullets
2. Mobile: Timeline should stack vertically with adjusted spacing
3. Check bullet positioning doesn't overlap text
4. Verify proper indentation of job descriptions

**Typography & Spacing**
- [ ] Job titles remain readable (min 1.7rem on small mobile)
- [ ] Company names properly sized (min 1.4rem on small mobile)  
- [ ] List items have proper indentation
- [ ] Timeline blocks don't crowd together

### 4. Skills Section Test
**Grid Behavior**
- Desktop (1024px+): 3-column grid
- Tablet (768px): 2-column grid
- Mobile (480px): 1-column grid
- Verify no horizontal scrolling occurs

**Card Responsiveness**
- [ ] Cards maintain proper aspect ratio
- [ ] Icons scale appropriately (80px ‚Üí 60px)
- [ ] Text remains centered and readable
- [ ] Adequate spacing between cards

### 5. Footer Test
**Current Design (Split Layout)**
1. Check social icons are properly sized
2. Verify all links are touch-friendly
3. Test email link opens properly
4. Ensure no list bullets appear

## üîß Browser Testing

### Required Browsers
- [ ] **Chrome/Chromium** (Primary testing)
- [ ] **Safari** (iOS simulation)
- [ ] **Firefox** (Secondary)
- [ ] **Edge** (Windows compatibility)

### iOS Specific Testing
If possible, test on actual iOS devices:
- [ ] Safari on iPhone
- [ ] Chrome on iPhone
- [ ] Check for iOS-specific rendering issues

## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Layout Issues
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling on any screen size
- [ ] Text overflow or cut-off
- [ ] Images not scaling properly
- [ ] Cards/sections overlapping

### Typography Issues  
- [ ] Text too small to read comfortably
- [ ] Line spacing too tight
- [ ] Font loading failures
- [ ] Inconsistent font sizes

### Interactive Issues
- [ ] Buttons/links too small to tap easily
- [ ] Hover effects stuck on touch devices
- [ ] Menu not opening/closing properly
- [ ] Scroll behavior issues

### Performance Issues
- [ ] Slow loading on mobile connections  
- [ ] Janky animations
- [ ] Layout shifts during loading
- [ ] Memory issues on older devices

## üìã Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Automated Resize Testing
1. Open Developer Tools
2. Set device simulation to "Responsive"
3. Start at 1400px width
4. Slowly drag to reduce width to 320px
5. Note any break points where layout breaks

### Step 2: Specific Device Testing
1. Test each device from Priority 1 list
2. Portrait orientation first
3. Test landscape if relevant
4. Check both touch simulation and actual devices if available

### Step 3: Cross-Browser Verification
1. Test primary devices in Chrome
2. Repeat key tests in Safari and Firefox
3. Focus on iOS Safari compatibility

### Step 4: Performance Testing
1. Use DevTools Network tab to simulate slow connections
2. Test on CPU throttled environment
3. Check for memory leaks during navigation
